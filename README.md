# Stefan Atanasov's Personal Site

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, hosted at **[dark1638.me](http://dark1638.me)**.

## 🚀 About
This site features a custom **Matrix Digital Rain** landing page effect built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It serves as a fun, interactive entry point to my online presence.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Theme:** Dark hacker aesthetic with a blinking cursor interface.
- **Tech Stack:** Pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript (no external dependencies).
- **Responsive:** Automatically adjusts to fit any screen size (mobile/desktop).

## 📂 Project Structure
